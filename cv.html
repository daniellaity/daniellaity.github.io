					<h1>Personal Profile</h1>
				</div>
				
<!-- 
					<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>Born and raised in the South Auckland suburb of Conifer Grove, 
						I attended Conifer Grove Primary and Intermediate School. The 
						teachers at my school were generous, helpful and hard-working 
						and played a large part in making me who I am today. </p>

					<p>Later, I attended Rosehill College. During my time in college, 
						I was asked by a local tennis coach to work as a part-time 
						coach. I continued to work for him full time after I finished 
						my schooling until he retired. At this point I was faced with 
						a decision: go to America to coach for Cliff Drysdale Tennis 
						where I was offered a position or to assume the role of club 
						coach for the clubs I had been working at. I chose to stay in
						New Zealand and start my own business. </p>

					<p>At the time I began my degree, I was providing services to five 
						different clubs in the South Auckland area. I employed and 
						managed one full-time coach and part-time coaches to help me 
						with my coaching responsibilities at each of the clubs. </p>

					<p>Tennis coaching sparked my interest in teaching. Teaching was 
						something that I had always thought about doing, but I 
						wasn&#8217;t quite sure if it was the path for me. Having 
						the opportunity to work with schools to deliver a coaching 
						programme, at the request of Tennis Auckland, convinced me 
						that teaching was the career for me. </p>

					<p>Tennis has been a big part of my life since I finished school. 
						However, I also have interests in many other areas. I know basic 
						HTML and CSS and created a web-based curriculum vitae to demonstrate 
						these skills. I have some experience coding but would like to learn
						 more. Currently, I am learning basic JavaScript. My interests 
						 are not limited to digital technologies. I also enjoy making and 
						 building things with my hands, whether it be building electronics, 
						 woodworking or sewing.</p>
