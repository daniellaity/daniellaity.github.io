					<h1>Personal Profile</h1>
				</div>
				
				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>Born and raised in New Zealand, I have lived in the South Auckland suburb of Conifer Grove my whole life. During my primary and intermediate years I attended Conifer Grove School. The teachers at my school where generous, helpful and hard working and played a large part in making me who I am today. While in college I was asked by a local tennis coach to work part time, I continued to work for him full time after I finished my schooling until he retired, at which point I was faced with a decision to, go to America to coach for Cliff Drysdale Tennis where I was offered a position or to assume the role of club coach for the clubs I had been working at. I choose to stay in New Zealand and start my own business. At the time I began my degree I was providing services for five different clubs in the South Auckland area and employed one full-time coach and part-time coaches to help me with my coaching responsibilities at each of the clubs. </p>

					<p>Tennis coaching sparked my interest in teaching and working with schools to deliver a coaching programme convinced me that primary school teaching was the career path I wanted to take. Teaching was something that I had always thought about doing, but, I wasn&#8217;t quite sure if it was the path for me. Spending time in schools gave me the ability to talk with teachers and helped give me the confidence to pursue a teaching career.</p>

					<p>Tennis has been a big part of my life since I finished school, however, I also have interests in many other areas. I have a keen interest in learning new things about the world, this is why the sciences have always been an interest of mine. Discovering new things about how the world works is something I&#8217;m always trying to do, as I think being more informed makes us better citizens of the world. Technology is also an area of interest for me. I know basic HTML and CSS and have some experience coding but would like to learn more and am currently trying to learn basic javascript. I also enjoy making and building things with my hands, whether it be building electronics or woodworking.</p>

					<p>My Journey to becoming a qualified teacher is nearing its first major milestone and I am excited for what the future has to offer. Thank you for taking the time to consider my application.</p>
