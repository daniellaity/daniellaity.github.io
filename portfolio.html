			<h1>Ko Wai Au </h1>
				<p>I was born an raised in New Zealand. I have lived in the south Auckland suburb of Conifer Grove my whole life, this meant naturally I went to the local school, Conifer Grove School. I believe Conifer Grove School and its teachers played a large part in making me who I am today. I fondly remember sport being a big part of my time at Conifer Grove School. Lunchtime sports and class competitions were always a lot of fun. I think being physically active can have huge benefits both mentally and physically, so I am glad that sports was a big part of my school life.</p>
				
				<p>One sport we never played in school was tennis, but tennis is a sport I played regularly outside of school since I was a child. Tennis ended up being the sport that got me my first job and the sport that has kept me busy since I finished school. I started working part-time six years ago for a local coach after school when he asked if I could help him out. I continue to for him until he retired, at which point I was faced with a decision to go to America to coach for Cliff Drysdale Tennis where I was offered a position or start my own business here in New Zealand. I chose to start my own business. At the time I started my degree I was the head coach for five different clubs in the south Auckland area and employed one full-time coach and part-time coaches to help me with my coaching responsibilities at each of the clubs.&nbsp;</p>
				
				<p>Tennis coaching sparked my interest in teaching and allowed me to talk with a lot of teachers. Tennis Auckland would contract me to go into schools and take coaching lessons with classes as part of the Hot Shots programme. My experiences coaching in the schools is what convinced me that primary school teaching was the career path I wanted to take. Teaching was something that I had always thought about doing, but, I wasn't quite sure if it was the path for me. Spending time in the schools gave me the ability to talk with teachers and helped to give me the confidence that teaching was something that I wanted to do.</p>
				
				<p>Tennis has been a big part of my life since I left school, however, I also have interests in many other areas. I have a keen interest in learning new things about the world, this is why the sciences have always been an interest of mine. Discovering new things about how the world works is something I'm always trying to do, as I think being more informed makes us better citizens of the world. Technology is also an area of interest for me. I have some experience coding but would like to learn more in this area. I also enjoy making and building things with my hands, whether it be building electronics or woodworking, although, I can never seem to find the time to work on any projects.</p>
				
				<p>My Journey to becoming a qualified teacher has just begun and I am excited for what the future has to hold. Thank you for taking the time to read my Ko wai au.</p>

				<p>Teaching Beliefs</p>
				<ul>
					<li>It is a teachers aim to help students to behave in, and interact with the world with confidence, whether it be through learning new social skills or fundamental knowledge to help them in their future lives.</li>
					<li>As teachers we want to help children to take charge and responsibility of their own future and to not become victims of circumstance by allowing others to dictate what they can and can't do.</li>
					<li>Teachers should encourage children to strive to meet their potential and be the best they can be by challenging them. To do this teachers need to set up an environment where the children feel comfortable accepting challenges.</li>
